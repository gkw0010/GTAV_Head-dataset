# GTA_Head-dataset
GTA_Head is a large-scale virtual world dataset for crowd counting and head detection, including 5096 images labeled with 1732043 head bounding boxes. The images and target center coordinates are taken from GCC Dataset. We provide information for each visible head, including: xmin, ymin, length and width for training and evaluation of object detection model. There are 35 scenes in the dataset, including 24 scenarios in the training set and 11 scenarios in the test set. Compared with other datasets, GTA_Head provides pedestrian head annotations for a large number of complex scenes, including indoor shopping malls, subways and outdoor stadiums and squares. The annotation and data format of GTA_Head follows the standard guidelines outlined by MOTChallenge benchmark.
